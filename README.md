# passenger-game

In this mission, you are the driver and you need to pick up all the passengers that will randomly pop up on the screen.
To accomplish your task, you just need to keep an eye on the screen and whenever you see a new passenger, just click on it!

The time is running and if you leave 3 of your passengers behind, you loose the game.

If during your shift (until the time is over), you don't leave more than 3 of your passengers behind, you win the game.

You can select 2 levels of difficulty: 

**easy:** where passengers will pop up and wait for a longer time, which means you
have more time to seach for them before the next one pops up. 

**hard:** act fast! it is rush hour! show that you are speedy because passengers are popping up as crazy! If during your 
shift time that is running, you don't leave more than 3 of your passengers behind, you win!
